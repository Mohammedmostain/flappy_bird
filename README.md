# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a Python-based clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, developed using the Pygame library. It focuses on recreating the core gameplay mechanics, such as bird movement, obstacle navigation, and scoring, with added features like persistent high score tracking.

## Features

- **Core Gameplay**: Players control a bird, navigating through a series of pipes by adjusting its height with spacebar inputs.
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded for each set of pipes passed, with scores displayed in real-time and high scores saved across sessions.
- **Game Adjustments**: Game physics, including gravity and jump dynamics, have been fine-tuned for a balanced and enjoyable experience.


## Controls

- **Spacebar**: Make the bird jump.
- **R**: Restart the game after a game over.
- **Escape**: Exit the game.
